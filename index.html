          <h2 class="sub-title">About</h2>
          <p>
            Evelyn Evelyn is a musical duo formed by Amanda Palmer and Jason
            Webley. According to the fictional backstory described by Palmer and
            Webley, the duo consists of conjoined twin sisters, Evelyn and
            Evelyn Neville, who were discovered in 2007 by Palmer and Webley.
            The twins are actually portrayed by Palmer and Webley, dressed in
            connected bodysuits. The duo released their debut album in 2010.
            <br />
            <br />
            The opening track, Evelyn Evelyn, sets the stage for the album,
            delving into the convergence of all challenges faced by the twins.
            It melts down into an argument on the sisters' shared birthday. The
            essence of the song is the yearning for individuality, a desire to
            exist in separate worlds that is only but a dream for the
            intertwined sisters.

            Evelyn, Evelyn<br />
            Why do we bother to stay?<br />
            Why are you running away?<br />
            Don't you feel like severing?<br />
            Everything's just come together at last<br />
            It's broken, I don't want to play<br />
            <br />
            We grew up closer than most<br />
            Closer than anything, closer than anything<br />
            Shared our bed and wore the same clothes<br />
            Talked about everything, spoke about so many things<br />
            <br />
            What shall we wear tonight? What shall we eat today?<br />
            Can we go ice skating? But we just did that yesterday<br />
            Should we be firemen? Can we be astronauts?<br />
            What if they find us? They're not looking anyway<br />
            <br />
            Evelyn, Evelyn<br />
            Why do we bother to stay?<br />
            Why are you running away?<br />
            Don't you feel like severing?<br />
            Everything's just come together at last<br />
            It's broken, I don't want to play<br />
            <br />
            Fill my glass, let's drink a toast<br />
            This is our birthday, so why are we weeping?<br />
            At your side, I feel like a ghost<br />
            I wake up first, and I stare at you sleeping<br />
            <br />
            What shall we wear tonight? What shall we eat today?<br />
            Do you think I should marry him? But we just met him yesterday<br />
            Should we be movie stars? Will we be millionaires?<br />
            I want to be famous. They're watching us anyway<br />
            <br />
            Evelyn, Evelyn<br />
            Why do we bother to stay?<br />
            Why are you running away?<br />
            Don't you feel like severing?<br />
            Everything's just come together at last<br />
            It's broken, I don't want to play<br />
            <br />
            We grew up so very close<br />
            A parasite needs a host<br />
            I'm only trying to do what is best for us<br />
            Well, I never asked for this, I never wanted this<br />
            All that I want is some time to myself<br />
            <br />
            Looking in your eyes, I'm coming home<br />
            <br />
            Just get away from me, please just stop touching me<br />
            You're always trying to be somebody else<br />
            Now I realize I'm not alone<br />
            Well, you're only scared of me<br />
            <br />
            But you never cared for me.<br />
            Why don't you let me free?<br />
            'Cause you'd never dare to be<br />
            'Cause you never listen, you're always insisting<br />
            I'm just reminiscing (just stop reminiscing)<br />
            I feel something missing<br />
            I just want you here with me (I just want my privacy)<br />
            God can't we just get along (God won't you leave me alone)?<br />
            <br />
            Evelyn, Evelyn<br />
            Evelyn, Evelyn<br />
            Evelyn, Evelyn<br />
            Evelyn, Evelyn<br />
